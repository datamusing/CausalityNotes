# Association != Causation



Machine Learning systems have become exceptionally good at fitting trends/associations in data.  But they are not formulated to answer “What If” questions \(What would have happened if I administered medicine B to this patient who is currently under a  medicine A regimen?\).  Therefore,  data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither the parameters involved, nor the predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation.

 Models built for prediction do not guarantee trustable decisions or interventions.
