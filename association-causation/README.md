# Association != Causation



Machine Learning systems have become exceptionally good at fitting trends/associations in data.  But they are not formulated to answer “What If” questions \(What would have happened if I administered medicine B to this patient who is currently under a  medicine A regimen?\).   Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Models built for prediction do not guarantee trustable decisions or interventions.
